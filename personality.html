            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                My strongest traits, including my passion for cars, love for programming (particularly back-end
                development), interest in engineering, 3D printing, and designing Arduino circuits, have significantly
                impacted my academic life. These traits drive my curiosity and problem-solving skills, which I apply to
                my studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the realm of programming, I find joy in developing efficient and robust back-end solutions, which has
                improved my analytical thinking and coding abilities. My interest in engineering and 3D printing
                enhances my understanding of practical applications in various fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, my computer lab serves as a playground for experimenting with Linux systems, networking,
                and Docker containers. This hands-on experience has enriched my knowledge and provides a real-world
                context for my academic pursuits.
            </p>
            <h2>Spotify Playlist</h2>
            <p>Below is my favorite playlist that includes most, if not all, of my current favorite songs. I often
                listen to these tracks while working on programming projects and exploring my hobbies. The playlist is a
                reflection of my diverse musical taste and provides the perfect soundtrack for my creative endeavors.

                        simple. But itâ€™s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains." -
                        Steve Jobs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Steve Jobs is my hero and a source of inspiration because he was a visionary entrepreneur who
                        constantly pushed the boundaries of what's possible. His ability to simplify complex problems
                        and innovate in the tech industry resonates with my passion for technology and innovation.

            <h2>Personality Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                I have taken the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test using <a
                    href="http://www.keirsey.com/">keirsey.com/</a>. Below is a screenshot of the test results:

                <img src="Assets/personality.png" alt="Personality Test Result" class="fit-image">
            </div>
            <p>
                I believe that the test has validity to some extent. The assessment aligns with
                my interests and inclinations. I am genuinely passionate about creating things, whether through software
                development or engineering. My experience as a robotics engineer at St. Jago High School exemplifies my
                desire to build and innovate, especially in the realm of technology and robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I do find that my creativity is more focused on the technical side. While I enjoy creating and
                problem-solving in software and engineering, I find paintings and drawings to be quite challenging. It
                seems that my creative energies are channeled more towards the world of technology and tangible
                creations.
